# SQL-Tableau-Project
This project consists of a set of SQL Server queries aimed at analyzing a dataset related to Covid-19 from the years 2020 to 2022 at a global level. The queries are located in the "Queries.sql" file. The dataset can be found in the Excel file named "dataset", located in this same repository. To test the queries, this Excel file must be imported as a SQL table. The dataset was extracted from the "Our World in Data" website: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. The results of the last 4 queries from the "Queries" file were used to create charts in Tableau. The files for each chart can also be found in this same repository in ".twbx" format.
